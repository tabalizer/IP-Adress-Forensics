This Python script will help you to investigate IP-addresses with focus on extracting DNS, WHOIS, Requests, ipWhois information for a certain IP adress

To run the script, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need to install the following Python modules:

socket: This module provides a way to look up DNS information for an IP address.
whois: This module provides a way to look up WHOIS information for an IP address.
requests: This module provides a way to make HTTP requests to external APIs, which we will use to perform geolocation lookups.
ipwhois: This module provides a way to look up IP information, including RDAP information, for an IP address.
You can install these modules using pip, the Python package manager. Open a command prompt or terminal window, and type the following commands:

****
perl
Copy code
pip install socket
pip install python-whois
pip install requests
pip install ipwhois

Once you have installed these modules, you should be able to run the script without any issues.
